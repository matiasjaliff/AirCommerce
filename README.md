# AirCommerce

**AirCommerce** is an online retail store for urban and sports footwear üèÄ

As a *user* you will be able to search, view product details and add any of the available products to the cart. To proceed with the checkout of the cart, you must be logged in as a user, for which you must register in advance. Don't worry if you didn't log in before adding products to the cart, as you can do so later without losing the products you selected.

As *admin* you will be able to manage product inventory, modify price and other product attributes, and manage order fulfillment.

As *superadmin* you will be able to manage admin roles, in addition to all the functions of an admin.
